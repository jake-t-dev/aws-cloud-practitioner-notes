# Cloud Computing Deployment Models

## Public Cloud

Everything built on the CSP, aka Cloud Native/Cloud First

Use Case:

- New companies
- Small companies able to make the leap from a VPS to a CSP
- eg Startups, SaaS offerings, new projects

## Private Cloud

Everything built on company datacenters, aka On-Premise, could be OpenStack

Use Case:

- Orgs that cant move to cloud for compliance reasons
- Migration impossible due to sheer size
- eg Public Sector, Healthcare, large heavily regulated enterprises

## Hybrid Cloud

Both On-Premise and a CSP

Use Case:

- Orgs that started with their own datacenters but can't fully move to a CSP due to migration effort or compliance reasons
- eg FinTech, Investment Management, large Professional Services providers

## Cross Cloud

Aka multi-cloud, uses Multiple Cloud Providers
