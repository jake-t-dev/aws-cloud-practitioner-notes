A Cloud Service Provider is a computer that provides multiple cloud services that:

- Can be chained together
- Can be accessed through a Single Unified API (eg AWS API)
- Utilize metered billing
- Have rich monitoring built in (eg AWS CloudTrail)
- Come with an IaaS offering
- Offer automation via Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
