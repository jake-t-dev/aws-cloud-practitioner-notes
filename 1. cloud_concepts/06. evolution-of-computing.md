# Evolution of Computing

## Dedicated

- A physical server wholly utilized by a single computer
- Have to guess your capacity
- Overpaying for underutilized server
- No vertical scaling without manual migration
- Server replacement difficult
- Limited by Host OS
- Single use/conflicts in resource sharing

## VMs

- Multiple VMs on one machine
- Hypervisor software layer to run VMs
- Fractional cost of physical machine
- Will still overpay for underutilization
- Limited by Guest OS
- Can still have resource sharing conflicts
- Easy to migrate through image import/export
- Easy to scale horizontally/vertically

## Containers

- VMs running multiples containers
- Docker Daemon software layer
- Maximises utilisation of available capacity
- Containers share the same underlying OS so more efficient that multiple VMs
- Multiple apps can run in parallel without conflicts with resource sharing

## Functions

- Managed VMs running managed containers
- Known as Serverless Compute
- Only responsible for code and data, nothing else
- Very cost effective, only pay for the time the code is running, VMs only run when code needs to be executed.
- Can suffer side effects of cold starts
